## Introduction
This is work in progress text where I document my findings about USIFAC2. USIFAC2 is an expansion rom for CPC which provides a serial connection, is able to load programs from USB sticks and has wifi and bluetooth support.
You can find more info on the thread https://www.cpcwiki.eu/forum/amstrad-cpc-hardware/usifac-iimake-your-pc-or-usb-stick-an-hdd-for-amstrad-access-dsk-and-many-more!

## Hardware
USIFAC2 is composed of few components, a microcontroller PIC18F47Q10, a diode and a couple of capacitors. A schematic of the circuit is provided at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ua4vgf6qjjmqlnq/AACi-NI8lLCniHfSaHBJnOl_a/Usifac_ii_schematic.jpg?dl=0

## Software
ikonsgr, the author of USIFAC2 has nicely shared the source code and it is available at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ua4vgf6qjjmqlnq/AACT6kqTr-sst-iqDeBnE9gRa?dl=0
